and identifying and defining a core set of values to help ensure consistency in decision-making across the organization. The strategic plan is intended to inform stakeholders about what
 the organization will be focusing on over the next four years and articulates a set of core activities along with specific goals that the CSIO is striving to achieve over this 
 timeframe.</p><br>
