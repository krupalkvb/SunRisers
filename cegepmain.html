<h2>History</h2><br>
<p>The Ministry of Education for Quebec was created in 1964. The regional school commissions of the Baie-des-Chaleurs,and the Peninsula were created in 1964
 to serve the Gaspésie–Îles-de-la-Madeleine region at the primary and high school level. In 1967,several institutions were merged and became public ones, when
 the Quebec system of CEGEPs was created, a network of public colleges throughout the province. In Quebec City, the ministry decided against a public college 
 in the Gaspésie. Consequently, students were to be sent to the Collège de Rimouski for highschool.The Centre spécialisé des pêches in Grande-Rivière was founded
 in 1983. The Centre des Îles was created in the Magdalen Islands in 1983. In 1989 the Centre de Carleton was created in the Chaleur Bay. The University du Québec 
 in Rimouski (UQAR) decentralized its teaching and developed part-time programs between La Pocatière and Gaspé, including the Magdalen Islands and the Hauterive
 area since 1969. In 1971, a partnership agreement was signed between UQAR and the continuing education college services  regarding adult education.
In 1974 the UQAR began to decentralize part-time education. Three regional offices: in Gaspé, Carleton and Matane were created.</p><br>
<h2>Programs</h2>
<p>The CEGEP offers two types of programs: pre-university and technical. The pre-university programs, which take two years to complete, cover the subject matters
 which roughly correspond to the additional year of high school given elsewhere in Canada in preparation for a chosen field in university. The technical programs,
 which take three-years to complete, applies to students who wish to pursue a skill trade. In addition Continuing education and services to business are provided.</p>
